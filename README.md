AoPS is a simple bot that pulls math problems from [Art of Problem Solving](https://artofproblemsolving.com) into your Discord channel.

# How Does it Work?

Just mention **@AoPS** and it will fetch a random problem. New problem sets will continue to be added and AoPS bot will inform you of how difficult the problem is. If you don't like the problem, simply request a new one!
